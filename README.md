## Team Workflow
- `git fetch origin` to update your local repository to include the latest changes from the remote main branch.
- `git merge origin/main` to merge with the latest changes before new push
- create a new merge request and assign yourself to assignee
- Assign anyone else to reviewer to review the code before allowing the merge request
